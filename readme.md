The author notes:

Logical table. Fields accept a column that references their field name. Moreover, if a field was deleted and added, then a duplicate column will not be created in the table, and new records will correspond to this value.

The use of special characters in the input data is limited, and the maximum length is limited.

Fieldnames and choices can not be duplicated.
